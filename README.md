This is the corporate website for Performance Plastics Ltd, a plastic manufacturing company in Mauritius. I originally made this website using wordpress but after learning web development, I have updated the website to use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org) (formerly Netlify CMS); The website is hosted on a private webserver with a staging instance available on Netlify: https://performancemu.netlify.app
