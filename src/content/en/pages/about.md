[Performance Plastics Ltd](/plastics) was founded in 1990. It all started inside a 100 m² room in Port Louis,  Mauritius. Now located in the Industrial Zone of Riche Terre, our factory occupies a 3,600 m² building. Performance has grown a lot over the years, which we proudly attribute to our level of service. Our customers know us for our honesty and reliability.

What makes Performance stand out is our company philosophy of **Value, Service and Quality**. We deliver our products at competitive prices, on time, and everywhere in Mauritius, as well as certain regions of Africa. We work closely with our customers to find the best solution for them. We flexible and adaptable which is why our client-base encompasses various industries, ranging from hospitality to retail, and agriculture.

Following the ‘Environment Protection (Banning of Plastic Bags) Regulations 2015’, prohibiting the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags in January 2016, Performance adapted quickly and promptly. In March 2016, we started producing 100% BIODEGRADABLE handle bags for major supermarkets and retail outlets across the island.

The year 2018 saw the the creation of [Performance Equipment](/equipment). It marked the beginning of a new chapter for Performance. This new business venture is the first step towards diversifying our enterprise. We aim to respond to the needs of the market, and we want to achieve this goal by applying the same philosophy we developed with Performance Plastics.
