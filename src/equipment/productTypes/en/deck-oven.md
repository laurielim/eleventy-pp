Deck ovens use conduction heat to bake products. Conduction heating is a process in which heat travels directly from a hot stone or deck, to the loaf of bread or sheet pan being baked. Deck ovens also utilize radiant heat, which is a process that utilizes infrared heat waves to penetrate into the dough, heating it throughout.

The ability to add steam with these types of ovens is also key in the bread baking process, and because deck ovens carry so much mass they have great recovery time and hold temperature very well.
