  In most pastry shop or bakery you will find at least one planetary mixer. The
  reason these mixers are so common is that they offer greater versatility. The
  paddle attachment is used for blending or creaming products. The whip
  attachment is commonly used to aerate mixtures, and lastly, the dough hook
  attachment is used to make doughs.


  Standard attachments include a ***paddle***, a ***whip***, and a ***dough*** hook. These machines also come with 3 speed options to accommodate different mixing needs.
